Lianj's git-wiki
==================

Everyone needs a fork of git-wiki; so here's mine too.

I've changed a few matters of taste, as well:

  * no sinatra
  * no grit
  * no haml
  * works on bare repos

Install
-------

This git-wiki requires Git, Rack and RDiscount.

    % cd git-wiki
    % ruby git-wiki.rb some/wiki.git <listen-port>
