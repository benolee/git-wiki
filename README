Lianj's git-wiki
==================

Everyone needs a fork of git-wiki; so here's mine too.

I've changed a few matters of taste, as well:

  * (add me)

Install
-------

This git-wiki requires Rack, Grit, Haml, and RDiscount.

Caveats
-------

Because we use Grit by modifying the workdir and then calling `git
add`, git-wiki must be run with a non-bare wiki repo. If you want to
clone this repo and then push to it, you should read the [Git FAQ
entry][faq] about the perils of pushing to a repo with a checked-out
workdir.

In practice, you will hopefully never edit the workdir of the "live"
repo directly, so ensuring that receive.denyNonFastForwards is turned
on and adding a post-update hook to reset the index is a reasonable
(if not very clean) work-around.
